The "PriceTracker" project is a Python-based application designed to monitor and track product prices across various e-commerce websites. By leveraging web crawling and web scraping techniques, the program automatically retrieves and analyzes price data to provide users with real-time updates on price changes and discounts.

The project utilizes popular Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests to extract HTML content and parse product information, while Selenium can be used for more dynamic pages that require JavaScript execution. The application allows users to input URLs of the products they wish to track and set alerts for when prices drop to a desired level.

This project is ideal for learning web scraping techniques, handling HTTP requests, and working with data extraction and manipulation. It also emphasizes ethical scraping practices and compliance with website terms of service. Overall, PriceTracker offers a practical solution for consumers looking to optimize their online shopping experience.
